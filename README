If you want to know why this software exists, please read the README file of ch.oddb.org at scm.ywesee.com

yus is only running on Ruby1.8

Install the following packages with gem:

	needle (1.3.0)
	pg (0.9.0) 
	postgres (0.7.9.2008.01.28)

Make sure you got the directory

	/etc/yus/
	/etc/yus/data/

with the files

	/etc/yus/data/yus.crt  
	/etc/yus/data/yus.key
	/etc/yus/data/yus.key.enc

and also 

	/etc/yus/yus.yml

the content of the yaml-file should be

	---
	root_name: email@domain.com
	root_pass: 7322we3asalkasdfkjl9234kjljasd234234ljsdlfkasjw23235lajsdfwr3scv
	log_level: DEBUG
	ssl_key: /etc/yus/data/yus.key
	ssl_cert: /etc/yus/data/yus.crt
	session_timeout: 3600

To create the keys do

sha256.rb (for the sha256 value of password) with your Ruby-Script
	
	require 'digest/sha2'
	print Digest::SHA256.hexdigest('password'),"\n"

for id_rsa.crt
	
	$ openssl req -new -x509 -key .ssh/id_rsa -out .ssh/id_rsa.crt

Create a new user with

	yus_add_user email@domain.com login ch.oddb.RootUser

If you create a new user you have to make sure that

	bin/yusd

is running.

To run the tests you are gonne need

	flexmock (0.8.6)

[IMPORTANT]
* You should NOT install dbd-pg-0.3.x for the postgreSQL driver and
  dbi-0.4.x, because it has already been known that the dbd-pg-0.3.x
  depends on the library, deprecated-0.2.x, that causes an error.

* ruby-dbi version via emerge that works is 0.2.0-r1

* Install odba (from scm.ywesee.com)

[SETUP POSTGRES DB]
$ su - postgres
$ createuser yus
$ createdb yus
$ exit
$ cd [yus-git-reposito]
$ ruby bin/yusd
